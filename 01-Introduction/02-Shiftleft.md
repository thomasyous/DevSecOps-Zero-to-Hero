**shift‑left in DevSecOps**

# 🔄 Shift‑Left in DevSecOps

Shift‑left means **doing security early instead of late**.  
That’s the core idea. It should be implemented in Dev and Staging environment itself.

But the real meaning goes deeper than just “secure the pipeline.”

# 🧩 What Shift‑Left *Really* Means

## ⭐ 1. **Security starts at the very beginning**
Not after coding  
Not after deployment  
Not after an incident  

Security begins **when the idea is born**.

---

## ⭐ 2. **Developers get security tools early**
Instead of waiting for a security team to review things at the end, developers get:
- Code scanners  
- Secret scanners  
- Dependency checkers  
- IaC scanners  
- Container scanners  

This means they catch issues **before** they even push code.

---

## ⭐ 3. **Automation handles most security checks**
Shift‑left is not about adding more manual work.  
It’s about:
- Automated scans  
- Automated tests  
- Automated policies  
- Automated approvals  

Security becomes part of the workflow, not a blocker.

---

## ⭐ 4. **Security becomes everyone’s job**
Not just the security team.  
Not just DevOps.  
Not just Ops.

**Dev + Sec + Ops share responsibility from day one.**

---

## ⭐ 5. **Fixing early = cheaper, faster, safer**
Catching a vulnerability in:
- Code → costs almost nothing  
- Build → small fix  
- Deployment → expensive  
- Production → VERY expensive  

Shift‑left saves time, money, and headaches.

# 🧠 One‑Sentence Definition
**Shift‑left means moving security to the earliest stages of development so issues are found and fixed before they become big problems.**
